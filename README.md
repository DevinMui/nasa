# NASA SpaceApps Hackathon Challenge

### Project

Build a drone that collects information about the environment for farmers and such to reduce water usage and spread awareness about the drought in California. Please ignore the swear words in the commit messages. We built this at a hackathon and we were really tired. Won the NASA SpaceApps Best App/Tech Idea prize!

### How it works

You can either use Alexa, iOS app, or web server to call the drone to a specific destination where it will land and plant the soil sensor into the ground. The soil sensor will then send JSON data back to the server where it will be saved. The iOS app/web server will be able to show the data in a more human readable format. The drone flies back to the original destination and lands.
